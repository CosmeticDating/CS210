# CS210
A collection of past labs from 2017 and 2016 with comments to aid in the understanding of the CS210 module in Maynooth University.

Dr. Phil Maguire frankly does his best to turn students off programming, not intentionally however.  He grades the papers too hard, he doesn't know how to code properly himself.  I'm putting this code up here to help any students who wish to "just hack" his module and get through it.  The average grade in 2017-18 he handed out was 42%, with over 20 he failed.  I know for certain I did better than the grade he gave, having learnt off the very code provided here that compiles perfectly and understood it, at that.  I've told him so, don't put up with his pseudo intellectual BS.  Some people spend too long in academia and don't live in the real world.
